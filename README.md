## iCaMP Color Palette

Color palettes developed by Zachary Milstone, MD/PhD for use by the
integrative Cardiovascular Metabolism and Pathophysiology (iCaMP)
Program. Many of these palettes are colorblind friendly and have been
developed for use in conference and publication figures.

This package was created using the [Creating a colour palette package
vignette](https://mccarthy-m-g.github.io/palettes/articles/creating-packages.html)
and the [palettes
Package](https://mccarthy-m-g.github.io/palettes/index.html), both
developed by Michael McCarthy. Here are additional resources used in the
development of this package:

- [R Packages (2e) by Hadley Wickham & Jennifer
  Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/)
- [A Helpful Way to Install R Packages Hosted on
  GitHub](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/githubinstall/vignettes/githubinstall.html)

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
